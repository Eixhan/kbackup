- implement a way for restoring backups
- fix the exit-question dialog when exiting due to session stop
- when we have to create a tmp file before uploading to an URL,
  limit the size of this tmp file at least to what is available in the tmp partition
- check if a file that is archived into the backup is not the backup itself
