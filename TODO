- implement a way for restoring backups
- directories which are not completely selected shall show
  the parent checkbox greyed
- fix the exit-question dialog when exiting due to session stop

Idea from Alain Portal
For setting the max size of the slice, a choice in a menu between
- CD 650MB
- CD  700MB
- DVD 4,7GB
- Custom
- other predefined size if existed

and show spin box only for custom.
