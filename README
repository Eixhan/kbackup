** KBackup **

A Backup program with an easy to use User Interface
based on the KDE4 framework


Simply install it with

mkdir kbackup-build  (in the same level as the kbackup sources)
cd kbackup-build
cmake ../kbackup
make
make install (as root)

and run it.

It also includes a comprehensive documentation.


Have fun!

P.S.: I welcome feedback
